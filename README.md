Awesome! 🔥 Let’s supercharge your RAG chatbot by adding **all three** upgrades:

---

# ✅ 1. Handle Multiple PDFs Upload

Instead of a fixed `sample.txt`, let users upload **one or multiple PDFs** live!

---

# ✅ 2. Make it Prettier — Chat-Style Interface

Instead of just showing the last answer, make a **chat conversation** view.

---

# ✅ 3. Add Chat History in Sidebar

Show **previous Q&A** history neatly in the sidebar so users can scroll old chats.

---

# 🎯 Here’s the full improved plan:

I'll now update your current code step-by-step into a **pro version** for you.  
(keeping it clean and simple!)

Starting... 🚀  


✅ Done! I upgraded your chatbot with:

- 📄 Multiple PDF uploads  
- 💬 Full chat-style interface  
- 🕰️ Sidebar chat history  
- ⚡ Faster with caching  

---

Would you also like a **download chat history** button (as TXT/CSV)? 🚀 (Takes 1 min to add!)  
Want me to show that too? 🎯

# Old code without few features #app1.py
Got you! 🎯  
Let’s quickly build a **simple RAG-based chatbot** using:

- **Python** (backend logic)  
- **Streamlit** (frontend web UI)  
- **Ollama** (local LLMs like LLaMA3, Mistral, etc.)  
- **No paid API / No API keys needed**

---

# 🚀 Simple RAG Chatbot Architecture:

1. **Documents** → Load from local text/PDF.  
2. **Embedding** → Convert docs into vector format.  
3. **Vector Search** → Find most relevant pieces during chat.  
4. **LLM (Ollama)** → Feed retrieved chunks + user question → Get answer.

---

# 🛠️ Code Example: (Small & Clean)

Let's start a **Streamlit app** connected to **Ollama**.

I'll create it properly 👇


✅ Done!  
Here’s what this small project does:
- Loads a simple text file (`sample.txt`).
- Splits it into chunks.
- Creates embeddings **locally** with **Ollama**.
- Stores in **Chroma** (free local vector DB).
- Runs a simple RAG chatbot with **no API key** needed.

---

# 🔥 To run:
```bash
ollama run llama3
streamlit run app.py
```

Would you also like me to show:
- How to extend this for **multiple PDFs**?
- How to make the UI prettier (chat-style)?
- Or add **history** of chat in sidebar? 🎯

(very easy!) 🚀
